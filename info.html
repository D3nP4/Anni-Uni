        <h2>Awareness and Perspective</h2>
        <p>
          It is about creating awareness for different perspectives. Zooming in and zooming out more than
          overthinking. Looking from a different angle, because sometimes if you zoom out you see the whole picture
          and do not get stuck in a detail that does not work without context. At other times, you need to zoom in
          for a deeper understanding. It is a reminder to think about what you need. To think about yourself in the
          whole constellation. You are part of it. Movement comes from within. If you keep walking, you will see and
          experience different things. The way you see the sculpture now is different than how you saw it a minute ago,
          and different from how you will see it after the presentation, or in a year.

        <h2>From Our Carrier Bag</h2>
        <p>
          Mental health moved us through the different approach to the person behind the design in this project. "How
          are you today?" is a simple question to follow up on each other. We wanted to take this further in our
          project. To get an idea of what is behind the design, the actions, and the person. What do they carry?

        <h2>Architecture Context</h2>
        <p>
          Architecture is often only about the winning project. Performing under pressure and being present even after
          weeks of hard work and long nights. Many other study courses are similar, and often this creates a feeling of
          being against each other. A simple question can add a personal touch. It can create the feeling of being in
          this together and not being alone with a problem. It helps people find others to talk to and exchange with.

        <h2>Translated Into Design</h2>
        <p>
          Three columns stand together. Each is individual, but all include one ongoing image. Perfect from one side,
          closed up and fitting. When you walk around and explore further, you notice openings and imperfections. We
          began to like this side even more. If you take time to go deeper, not only look from far away, they open up
          and show their inner beauty. They have a question for you, where you can open up, show some of your inner
          thoughts, and give space to chat and share something from your own carrier bag.
