        <h2>Awareness For Different Perspectives</h2>
        <p>
          It is about creating awareness for different perspectives. Zooming in and zooming out more than
          overthinking. About looking from a different angle, cause sometimes if you zoom out you see the whole
          picture and do not get stuck at a detail that does not work without context. Or you need to zoom in for a
          deeper understanding. A reminder to think about what you need. To think about you in the whole
          constellation(mirror) you are part of it. Movement comes from within. If you keep walking, you will see and
          experience different things. The way you see the sculpture now is different than how you saw it a minute ago
          and how you will see it after the presentation, or in a year.

        <h2>From Our Carrier Bag</h2>
        <p>
          Mental health we were moved by the different approach to the person behind the design in this project. How
          are you today? A simple question to follow up on each other. We wanted to take this idea further in our
          project. To get an idea whats behind the design, the actions, the person. What do they carry?

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          is often only about the winning project. Performing under pressure and being present even after weeks of hard
          work and long nights. A lot of other study corses are the same, often it creates a feeling of being against
          each other. A simple question can ad a personal touch. Give the feeling of being in this together. Not being
          alone with a problem. Finding people to talk, to exchange.

        <h2>Translated In Our Design</h2>
        <p>
          Three columns, standing together, each individual but including one ongoing picture within. Perfect from one
          site, closed up and fitting. When you walk around, explore it further, you will notice openings and
          imperfections. But we began to like this side even more. If you take time to go deeper, not only looking from
          far away they open up to you, show their inner beauty. They have a question for you, where you can open up a
          bit, show some of your inner thoughts and give a space, to chat and share something from your own carrier bag.
